    "Again, I am consistently observing that the models use the respective Chalk Seeds as the most important feature. For the tree models, `Seeds are 3x more important` than the next feature on average. Also, XGBoost did not use the recent 10/5 game trends as a feature of importance, which is different than the other tree models. Given that none of these models have performed better than the dummy logic. I will have to attempt to adjust the features and target values in hopes of achieving better results. "
